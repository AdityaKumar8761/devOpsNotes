A group password in Unix-like systems is used to allow a user to temporarily gain membership in a group they are not already a part of, by providing the correct password when using the newgrp command.
 This feature enables users to access the permissions and resources associated with that group for the duration of their session.
 The primary purpose is to facilitate cooperation between different users by granting temporary access to shared resources without permanently adding them to the group.
